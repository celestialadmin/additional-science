## Static Eletricity

1. When two insulating materials rub together, electrons will scrap off. One material will lose electrons and have a positive charge and one will gain electrons and have a negative charge. This is known as static electricity.
2. Similar charges, objects will repel. Opposite charges, objects will attract.
3. If a negatively charged object is held near a wall, it repels the electrons in the wall away from the surface. The object is then charged and attracts the object. This is known as an induced charged. Positive objects have the same effect, but by attracting extra electrons in the wall towards the surface to make it negative.

Classic example: Polythene and acetate rods being rubbed together with a cloth duster.

Polythene:
* Electrons move away from the duster to the rod. The rob becomes negatively charged and the duster is left with an equal positive.

Acetate:
* Electrons move from the rod to the duster. Duster becomes negatively charged and rod becomes equally positive.

**FORCES GET WEAKER THE FURTHER THE OBJECTS ARE AWAY FROM EACH OTHER**

SPARKS CAUSED BY PARTICLES TRYING TO REARRANGE THEMSELVES.

#### Uses and Dangers of Static Electricity

* Build up electrostatic charge in body by walking. If you then touch metal, you will feel a shock as built-electrons move from you to the earth (or other way round) through the metal.
* Static electricity can build up on clouds and cause lightning.
* Electrostatic charges can build up on aircraft and refueling pipes, which is dangerous. A spark caused by static electricity discharging could ignite the fuel. To prevent this, a bonding line is used to earth aircraft before refueling (earthing). Fuel hosing also made from conducting materials.
* Electrostatic paint guns are charged, which charge up the small paint droplets. Each drop repels all the others, and they all have the same charge, so you get a very fine spray. The object to be painted gets an opposite charge to the gun. This attracts the paint. Result of this: Even coating, little wasted.

#### Electric currents
* All materials contain electrons. In conducting materials like metals, some of the electrons are free to move.
* In a complete electric circuit the cell pushes all the free electrons in the same direction at once around the circuit.
* This flow of electrons is called an electric current. Cell and batteries make the electrons flowing the circuit move in the same direction all the time, producing a direct current. Generators produce alternating current, where the electrons change direction many times per sec.
* Current: Rate of flow of charged particles. Its size depends on how much charge passes a particular point each second.
* When the current flows past a point in a circuit for a length of time then the charge that has passed is given by this formula:
```
Charge = Current x Time
```
