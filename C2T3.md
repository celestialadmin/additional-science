## Covalent Bonding

Covalent bonds are formed when atoms share electrons. This method makes both atoms feel as though they have an outer shell, and makes them happy.

Each covalent bond provides one extra shared electron for each atom.

Each atom involved has to make enough covalent bonds to fill up its outer shell.

When atoms make covalent bonds with one or more other atoms, they form a molecule.

## Covalent Substances

There are two types of covalent substances: 1. Simple molecular 2. Giant molecular

#### Simple molecular covalent substances

* Make very strong bonds to form small molecules of two or more atoms
* Attractions between atoms is very weak
* Inter-molecular forces are very weak so bonds are easily broken and have low melting and boiling points
* Most are gases or liquids at room temperature
* Don't conduct electricity, simply because there is no ions

#### Giant molecular covalent substances

* Similar to ionic lattices except there are no charged particles
* All atoms bonded by strong bonds
* Very high melting and boiling points
* Apart from graphite, they don't conduct electricity
* Usually insoluble.
* Examples include diamond and graphite

#### Diamond is hard ...

Diamond is hard because each carbon forms four covalent bonds in a very rigid giant covalent structure. Can't conduct electricity because there are no free electrons.

#### Graphite conducts ...

Graphite is in sheets or layers. These can be broken off easily. Each atom only has three bonds leaving the fourth electron free. This is why it can conduct electricity.

## Separation Techniques

Some liquid mixtures are **immiscible** and some are **miscible**.

#### Separating Immiscible Liquids

Pour the liquids into a separating funnel and wait for the denser liquid to sink to the bottom and for the liquids to separate. Then use a tap to drain off the denser liquid into a beaker.

#### Separating Miscible Liquids

These liquids can be separated using fractional distillation. The liquids must be cooled and then heated first to the lower of the two's boiling temperature. Once the first liquid has been collected you can increase the temperature and boil the second.

Fractionally distilling Air:

1. Air is filtered to remove dust.
2. It's then cooled to around -200 degrees and becomes a miscible mixture of liquids.
3. During cooling water vapour condenses and is removed.
4. Carbon dioxide freezes and is removed.
5. The liquified air then enters the fractionating column and is heated slowly.
6. The remaining gases are separated by fractional distillation. Oxygen and argon come out together so another column is used to separate them.

## Chromatography

Chromatography is used to identify substances

**The process ...**
1. Put dots of each mixture along a line on filter paper.
2. Fill a beaker with a solvent, such as ethanol or water, to a point where the strip of paper will start absorbing the solvent.
3. Wait for the water to separate the dots and watch it climb the paper.

You can calculate the R<sub>f</sub> value by dividing the distance the mixture has traveled by the distance the solvent traveled. This is used in the food industry and forensic science to help scientists identify different solutions and mixtures.
