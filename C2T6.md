## Relative Formula Mass

Essentially, the relative formula mass (M<sub>r</sub>), is all the relative atomic masses of each atom added together in a formula. So, the M<sub>r</sub> for Magnesium Chloride is ...

**MgCl<sub>2</sub>**

A<sub>r</sub> for Mg = 24
A<sub>r</sub> for Cl = 35.5

24 + (35.5 x 2) = 95

EASY PEASY!

## Two Formula Mass Calculations
#### Calculating % composition by mass of elements in a compound

This is finding out how much of a particular element there is in a compound:

---

Example:
Find the percentage mass of sodium in sodium carbonate, Na<sub>2</sub>Co<sub>3</sub>.

**A<sub>r</sub>** of sodium = 23, **A<sub>r</sub>** of carbon = 12, **A<sub>r</sub>** of oxygen = 16

M<sub>r</sub> of Na<sub>2</sub>Co<sub>3</sub> = (2 x 23) + 12 + (3 x 16) = 106

Percentage MASS = A<sub>r</sub> x n / M<sub>r</sub> x 100 = 23 x 2 / 106 x 100 = 43.4%

#### Finding the empirical formula

An example:

* 0.6g of Hydrogen
* 4.8g of oxygen

Calculate the empirical formula:

0.6g / 1(A<sub>r</sub> of Hydrogen) = 0.6

4.8 / 16 (A<sub>r</sub> of Oxygen) = 0.3

0.6 / 0.3 = 2 | 0.3 / 0.3 =1

DIVIDING by the smallest outcome above ^

Formula = H<sub>2</sub>O

#### Calculating masses in reactions

1. Write out the balanced equation
2. Work out the M<sub>r</sub> - just for the two bits you want
3. Apply the rule: Divide to get one, then multiply to get all

Example:

What's the mass of magnesium oxide produced when 60g of magnesium is burned in the air?

1. 2Mg + O<sub>2</sub> -> 2MgO
2. 2 x 24 -> 2 x (24 + 16)

 equal to = 48 -> 80
3. So 48g of Magnesium reacts to make 80g of magnesium oxide so ... divide 80/48 to find 1g of magnesium produced, and then times it by 60 to get the answer.

## Percentage Yield

Percentage yield compares the actual yield and theoretical yields.
![Percentage Yield](http://moodleshare.org/pluginfile.php/8902/mod_page/content/1/Stoichiometry/Images/Topic_7/_Yield_Equation.jpg)

Yields are always less than 100%. This is due to incomplete reactions, practical losses during preparations and unwanted reactions.

Waste in reactions cost money since it can be difficult to dispose of because it may be harmful.
