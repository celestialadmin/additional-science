## Energy transfer in Reactions

Energy must always be supplied to break bonds.

During chemical reactions, old bonds and new bonds are formed. Energy must be supplied to break bonds - so bond breaking is an *endothermic* process. Energy is released when new bonds are formed - so bond formation is an exothermic process.

#### In an Exothermic Reaction - Energy is given out.

In an exothermic reaction, the heat energy released in forming bonds in the products is great than the energy used in breaking old bonds in the reactants.

> An EXOTHERMIC reaction is on which overall GIVES OUT ENERGY to the surroundings in the form of heat, shown by the rise in temperature.

* Combustion gives out a lot of heat - it's very exothermic. That's because making new bonds in the products (water and CO<sub>2</sub>) gives out much more energy than it takes to break bonds in the fuel.
* Explosions are Exothermic - lots of heat energy released.

#### In an Endothermic Reaction - Energy is taken in

The energy required to break old bonds in the reactants is greater than the heat energy released when new bonds are formed in the products.

> An ENDOTHERMIC reaction is one which overall TAKES IN ENERGY from the surroundings in the form of heat, shown by the fall in temperature.

Endothermic reactions are less common, here's an example:

* Photosynthesis uses light energy from the sun to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen.

## Energy Changes and Measuring temperature

#### Energy level diagrams show if it's Exothermic or Endothermic.

If the product is at a lower energy than the reactant, it's an Exothermic diagram. The difference in height represents the energy given out during the reaction.

If the product is at a high energy than the reactant, it's an Endothermic diagram. The difference in heigh represents the energy taken in during the reaction.

#### Measuring temperature change

You can measure by ...
1. Taking the temperature of the reactants
2. Mixing them in a polystyrene cup and then measuring the temperature of the solution at the end of the reaction. Easy.

A big problem is heat loss, you can reduce this by putting the polystyrene cup into a beaker of cotton wall to give it more insulation.

## Rates of Reactions

The rate of reaction is how quickly the reaction takes place.

**The rate of reaction depends on 4 things:**

1. Temperature
2. Concentration (or pressure for gases)
3. Catalyst (a substance that changes the speed of a reaction, without being changed or used up)
4. Surface area of a solid - (or size of particles)

## Collision Theory

Collision theory simply states that the rate of reaction depends on how often or how hard the reacting particles collide with eachother.

More collisions increases the rate of reaction.

Higher temperatures increase the speed at which the particles are moving, which therefore increases the number of collisions.

Increasing the concentration means that there will be more particles to collide with one another, which therefore increases the rate of reaction.

If one of the reactants is a solid then breaking it up into smaller pieces will increase its surface area. This means the particles around it in the solution will have a larger area to react with, so the number of collisions will increase.
