## Respiration
Respiration is the process used by all living organisms to release energy from organic molecules - which is usually glucose.

More simply, respiration is how **all** living things get energy from food.

Or even ... Respiration is breaking down glucose to release energy.

## Aerobic Respiration
Aerobic respiration is respiration which uses oxygen and is the most effective method for releasing glucose.

**Glucose + energy -> Carbon dioxide + Water (+ Energy)**

**Raw Materials and waste diffuse in and out of the blood.**
* The circulatory system carries glucose, oxygen and carbon dioxide around the body inside the blood.
* The glucose, which is used in respiration, comes from the *digestive* system.
* The oxygen comes from the air breathed into our lungs.
* The carbon dioxide is breathed out.
* Glucose, oxygen etc. is diffused into and out of the cells via the capillaries.
* This means materials are transferred via the process of diffusion.

*Diffusion is the movement of particles from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration.*
* The bigger the difference in concentration, the faster the rate of diffusion.

**When you exercise more, you respire more.**

When you exercise, your muscles contract meaning you need more energy. Therefore, your breathing rate is increased so that more oxygen can get to your cells for respiration. Your heart rate will also increase to increase the rate that carbon dioxide is removed - all to speed up the rate of respiration.

However, your body can only increases its efficiency to a certain extent. Once it's at its optimum respiration level, aerobic respiration is no longer an option.

## Anaerobic Respiration
Anaerobic respiration occurs when there is not enough oxygen in your blood. Instead, glucose is quickly converted into lactic acid.

Anaerobic respiration does not produce as much energy as aerobic respiration. Instead it produces lactic acid which can cause cramp.

In effect, once you have stopped exercising, you owe your body the oxygen it needed. This is known as **oxygen debt**. The amount required is called the Excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (or EPOC). The time taken to gain back this oxygen is the time you may need after exercise for your breathing to return to its post exercise rate.

## Photosynthesis
*"A plant's way of making their own food :smiley:"*

Photosynthesis occurs in the chloroplasts of a leaf cell which contains chlorophyll. The chlorophyll absorbs sunlight and uses it to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose.

Leaves are adapted for efficient photosynthesis with a broad, large surface area, chlorophyll and small holes called *stomata's* which allow gases in and out.

Photosynthesis is limited by ...
1. Light intensity.
2. Concentration of carbon dioxide
3. Temperature.

## Osmosis
__Osmosis__ is the movement of water particles across a partially permeable membrane. This is due to diffusion of water moving across a concentration gradient.

A *partially permeable* membrane has small holes in it. This means water can move in and out of the membrane.

## Water in Plants

Roots have millions of root hairs covering their surface.
Root hairs take in water by *osmosis*. Having such a large surface area means plants can take in as much water as possible.

Root hairs also absorb minerals. Diffusion won't usually absorb the minerals into the roots so __active transport__ is required. Active transport uses the plants energy, released in respiration, to pull minerals from the soil.

## Transpiration

Transpiration is the loss of water from a plant. This is caused by the
evaporation and diffusion of water in the leaves. This prompts the plant to re-fill it's leaves with water. The water is transported up the __xylem vessels__ to replace the lost water.

## Collecting samples of the distribution of organisms.
1. __Pooters__ - collect ground insects. Pooters are just jars with two straws: one to suck air out and one to collect the insects.
2. __Pitfall Traps__ - collect ground insects. Pitfall traps are simply holes in the ground to catch insects. They are easy to enter but difficult to leave.
3. __Sweep Nets__ - collect animals from long grass.
4. __Pond Nets__ - collect animals from ponds.
5. __Quadrat__ - is used to study the frequency of small organisms in a given area. A quadrat is a square frame which makes it easier to count organisms in a small area.
