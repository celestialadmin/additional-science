## What's in a cell
All animals and plants are made of cells. Animal and plant cells have features in common, such as a nucleus, cytoplasm, cell membrane, mitochondria and ribosomes. Plant cells also have a cell wall, and often have chloroplasts and a permanent vacuole.

#### Animal Cell
1. Have a **Nucleus** (contains genetic material, which controls the activities of the cell).
2. Have **Cytoplasm** (most chemical processes take place here, controlled by enzymes).
3. Have a **Cell membrane** (controls movement of substances in and out of the cell).
4. Have a **Mitochondria** (most energy is released here through respiration).
5. Have **Ribosomes** (protein synthesis happens here).

#### Plant Cell
Have all of the Animal cell's parts.
1. Have a **Cell wall** (Strengthens the cell).
2. Often have **Chloroplasts** (contain chlorophyll, which absorbs light energy for photosynthesis).
3. Often have a **Permanent vacuole** (filled with cell sap to help keep it rigid).

#### Bacteria Cell
1. No **nucleus** present
2. Have a **cell wall** (similar to plant cell wall, but more flexible).
3. Have a **Cell membrane**.
4. Sometimes have a **Flagellum** (whip like tail).
5. Have two types of DNA (**Plasmid and Chromosomal**).

**Chromosomal** DNA carries most of the genetic information.
**Plasmid** DNA forms small loops and carries extra information.

#### Microscopes
**Microscopes** *are used to help us see what makes up a cell*

Magnification calculation:

**Length of object = length of magnified object / magnification**

For example, specimen appeared 10mm in length under microscope with a magnification of x 1000, calculation would be:

Length of object = 10 / 1000 = 0.1mm

## DNA and enzymes
DNA is a long molecule made up of twisted strands of bases A, T, C and G.

**Genes** are sections of DNA and each gene has the code for creating a specific protein. The sequence of bases in the genes determines which amino acids are created and joined to make a specify new protein or enzyme.

**Enzymes** are large molecules that speed up the chemical reactions inside cells. Each type of enzyme does a specific job. Enzymes are a type of protein, and like all proteins, they are made from long chains of different amini acids.

#### Aerobic respiration
Most of our energy comes from the process of aerobic respiration, which takes place inside the mitochondria of cells. Mitochondria are oval structures with a folded inner membrane. They occur in large numbers inside muscles and liver cells, where lots of energy is needed. Mitochondria hold a large number of different enzymes which are responsible for different stages of respiration.


#### Enzyme structure
Enzymes are soluble protein molecules that can speed up chemical reactions in cells. Like all proteins they consist of a string of different amino acid sub units.

*The amino acid must occur in the correct sequence for the enzymes to work. This sequence is controlled by the genetic code for the protein. These are held in DNA molecules.*

#### DNA
DNA molecules are very long but are packed into compact structures called **chromosomes**. Each DNA molecule consists of two twisted strands of bases that form a shape called a **double helix**.

The two strands are held together by weak hydrogen bonds between pairs of bases.

When a cell grows and divides into two, it first has to make a *duplicate* copy of each DNA molecule. This is done by the *bonds breaking* between the two strands, the strands *unwinding*, and then new bases joining each old strand to make new strands.

1. DNA spiral 'unzips'
2. Free nucleotides lock on to bases.
3. Two copies of original spiral formed.

#### Genetic Code
If **A** occurs in one strand of a DNA molecule it will form a bond with **T** in the other strand. **C** and **G** will also bond with each other. This way it is possible to predict the order of bases on the other strand if the bases on one strand are known.

The sequence of bases in one section of a DNA molecule controls the sequence of amino acids in one protein molecule. Each amino acid has its own code of three bases. Every time the sequence of three bases occurs in the DNA molecule, the same amino acid is added to make up the protein.

*There are four different bases in DNA (A, T, C and G)*.
