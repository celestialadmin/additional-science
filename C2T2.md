## Ionic Bonding

With Ionic bonding, atoms lose or gain electrons to form positively or negatively charged atoms (or groups of atoms) called ions. Because of the attraction of opposite charges, ions are strongly attracted to each other.

Atoms on the left hand side of the table have only one or two electrons in their outer shells, and they aren't happy about it! They want to get rid of them so they can have *a full outer shell*.

A shell with *one or two* electrons on its shell is keen to get rid, where as a shell which is nearly full is keen to get another electron.

A classic example of this is the reaction of sodium and chlorine:

Sodium has 1 electron on its outer shell, and so it gives it to Chlorine which has 7. At which point we are left with two ions -
Na<sup>+</sup> & Cl<sup>-</sup>

#### Groups 1, 2, 6 & 7 are most likely to form ions.
  * Elements in group 1 & 2 are **metals** and so they lose electrons to form **+ve ions** or **cations**.
  * Elements in group 6 & 7 are **non-metals** and so they gain electrons to form **-ve ions** or **anions**.

  When anions and cations join, they form **ionic bonds**.

  *(Only elements at opposites sides of the periodic will form ionic bonds)*
## Ionic Compounds

Ionic compounds all form in a similar way. All atoms end up getting what they wanted in an ionic compound - A full outer shell.

Ionic compounds have a regular lattice structure. This means they are closely packed. This is because ionic bonds have very strong forces of attraction between the oppositely charged ions.

Ionic compounds have HIGH Melting and Boiling points because there is very strong bonds between the ions and it takes a lot of energy to break them.

Ionic compounds also conduct electricity when aqueous (disolved) or molten. This is because in these states, the ions separate and are free to move and they can carry electric current.

## Naming Compounds

* When two different elements combine, the compounds name is something -IDE.
* When three or more elements combine and one of them is oxygen, the compound's name is something -ATE.

#### Working out the Formula of an Ionic compound

We can work out the formula of an ionic compound by looking at their charges. If an anion and a cation are to form an ionic compound, their charges must balance (become zero).

For example, you need one hydroxide ion (OH<sup>-</sup>) to balance on sodium ion (Na<sup>+</sup>), so the formula would be NaOH

You need 2 chloride ions (Cl<sup>-</sup>) to balance 1 magnesium ion (Mg<sup>2+</sup>), so the formula would be MgCl<sub>2</sub>

## Preparing Insoluble Salts

 Substance | Soluble?
 --- | ---
 common salts of sodium, potassium and ammonium | :white_check_mark:
 nitrates | :white_check_mark:
 common chlorides (except silver & lead chloride) | :white_check_mark:
 common sulfates (except lead, barium and calcium sulfate) | :white_check_mark:
 common carbonates and hydroxides (except for sodium, potassium and ammonium ones) | :x:

#### Making insoluble salts - Precipitation

Using the right combination of soluble salts, we can produce an insoluble salt with a precipitation reaction.

E.g. to make lead chloride (insoluble), we can react lead nitrate and sodium chloride (both soluble).


> lead nitrate + sodium chloride -> lead chloride + sodium nitrate

1. Dissolve lead nitrate into distilled water.
2. Do the same for the sodium chloride.
3. Pour both solutions into a small beaker and wait for the lead chloride to precipitate out.
4. Filter out the precipitate using a funnel and some filter paper into a conical flask.

## Barium metals

Barium sulfate is an insoluble salt and is used for xrays.

> Classic example question:
> Describe how you would make a pure, dry sample of barium sulfate, an insoluble salt. You can use any of the following: barium iodide, barium nitrate, potassium chloride, potassium sulfate.

Answer:

1. Mix solutions of **barium** nitrate and potassium **sulfate**
2. Filter out the precipitate of **barium sulfate**
3. Wash it with distilled water
4. Dry it on filter paper

#### Flame Tests
* Sodium ions give a yellow/orange flame.
* Potassium ions give a lilac flame.
* Calcium ions give a red flame.
* Copper ions give a blue/green flame.

To test ... use a clean wire loop which you can clean with hydrochloric acid and then by rinsing it with distilled water. Then dip it in your solution and burn it in the blue part of the bunsen burner.

## Testing for Negative ions

* Testing for carbonates
  * Test for the presence of carbon dioxide by bubbling the gas  through lime water. If the gas is carbon dioxide, the lime water turns milky.
  * This will test for carbonate ions, since carbonates react with dilute acids to form carbon dioxide.

* Testing for sulfates and chlorides
  * To test for sulfate ions, add dilute HCl and barium chloride solution and if a white precipitate is present, so are sulfate ions.
  * To test for chloride ions, add dilute nitric acid followed by silver nitrate. If a white precipitate is produced, then chloride ions are present.

#### Spectroscopy

Spectroscopy can be used to identify elements by the light patterns emitted in a heated sample. Each element present in a sample produces a different pattern.
