## Properties of Metals

Metals are on the *left*. Most elements are metals. Transition metals are found in the middle of the periodic table.

Metals are good conductors of electricity. This makes them great for making electrical wires. They are **malleable** - this means that they can be bent or hammered into different shapes.

Most metals are transition metals. As well as having the typical metal properties they also:

1. have high boiling points
2. form very colourful compounds (which can be used in hair dyes). They are also responsible for the colours in gemstones and pottery glazes.

Metal's properties are defined by their **structure**. Metals consist of a regular arrangement of atoms held together by *metallic bonds*.

The metallic bonds give the metal a giant structure consisting of positive ions and free electrons. Metallic bonds delocalise the outer electron(s) so they can move freely and conduct electricity.

This large structure allows layers of atoms to slider over one another allows metals to be shaped.

## Halogens

Group 7 elements are known as 'The Halogens'.

The Halogens all have 7 electrons in their outer shell - so they've all got similar properties. These Halogens include ...

* Chlorine
* Bromine
* Iodine

Halogens react with most metals to form salts called **Metal Halides**.

**2Al + 3Cl<sub>2</sub> -> 2AlCl<sub>3</sub>**

Halogens can react with Hydrogen to form Hydrogen Halides. Hydrogen Halides are soluble.

## Group 0 - The Noble Gases

Group 0 gases are all more or less inert and colourless. Inert meaning they don't react with much at all. This is because they have full outer shells.

Noble gases are also non-flammable and are hard to observe

Aragon is used to provide an inert atmosphere in filament lamps (light bulbs). As the argon is non-flammable it stops the very hot filament lamp from burning away. Helium, another Noble gas is used in hot balloons.
